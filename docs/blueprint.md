# **App Name**: AdStratSim

## Core Features:

- ROI Target Input: Allows advertisers to input 4 different ROI targets for a 24-hour period, divided into 6-hour windows.
- Bidding Simulation: Simulates the competitive bidding process based on the defined ROI targets, incorporating factors like pCVR, AOV, and pCTR.
- Performance Metrics Calculation: Calculates and displays key performance metrics such as total clicks, orders, ad spend, revenue, and delivered ROI for each 6-hour window and overall.
- Trade-off Analysis: The simulation results demonstrate the trade-off between aggressive and conservative ROI targets.
- pCVR Bias Tool: Based on the Target ROI, the simulator automatically adjusts the average pCVR parameter by adding a positive or negative bias, and thus simulate how target ROI can influence pCVR, based on the underlying tool formulas.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep blue (#2E5AA5) evoking trust and analytical thinking.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF0F5), to allow comfortable readability.
- Accent color: A vibrant teal (#45B8AC), used for key metrics and interactive elements to guide the user through the data.
